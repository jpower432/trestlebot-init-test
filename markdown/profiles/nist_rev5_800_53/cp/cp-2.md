    # This section contains the parameters that are part of this control.
  # Each parameter has properties. Only the profile-values and display-name properties are editable.
  # The other properties are informational.
  #
  # The values property for a parameter represents values inherited from the OSCAL catalog.
  # To override the catalog settings, use bullets under profile-values as shown below:
  #
  #   profile-values:
  #     - value 1
  #     - value 2
  #
  # If the "- <REPLACE_ME>" placeholder appears under profile-values, it is the same as if
  # the profile-values property were left empty.
  #
  # Some parameters may show an aggregates property which lists other parameters. This means
  # the parameter value is made up of the values from the other parameters. For parameters
  # that aggregate, profile-values is not applicable.
  #
  # Property param-value-origin is meant for putting the origin from where that parameter comes from.
  # In order to be changed in the current profile, profile-param-value-origin property will be displayed with
  # the placeholder "<REPLACE_ME>" for you to be replaced. If a parameter already has a param-value-origin
  # coming from an inherited profile, do no change this value, instead use profile-param-value-origin as follows:
  #
  #    param-value-origin: DO NOT REPLACE - this is the original value
  #    profile-param-value-origin: <REPLACE_ME> - replace the new value required HERE

# cp-2 - \[Contingency Planning\] Contingency Plan

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop a contingency plan for the system that:

  - \[4.\] Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system disruption, compromise, or failure;
  - \[5.\] Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls originally planned and implemented;
  - \[6.\] Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and
  - \[7.\] Is reviewed and approved by {{ insert: param, cp-2_prm_1 }};

- \[b.\] Distribute copies of the contingency plan to {{ insert: param, cp-2_prm_2 }};

- \[c.\] Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;

- \[d.\] Review the contingency plan for the system {{ insert: param, cp-02_odp.05 }};

- \[f.\] Communicate contingency plan changes to {{ insert: param, cp-2_prm_4 }};

- \[g.\] Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or actual contingency activities into contingency testing and training; and

## Control guidance

Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.

Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in [IR-4(5)](#ir-4.5) . Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the [IR](#ir) (Incident Response) family.
